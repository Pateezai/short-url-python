# Shortener
This project is the beginning of URL Shortener website practice start with using MongoDB, Python and Flask

At first I used Python in the 1st year of university project.So I'm quite familiar with it and it'd be a good chance for rusting 
the python skill and it's one of an easy language to understand efficiently. So it'd be fun to try with this project.
Moreover I used it in workplace during doing the shortener website

The idea is that normally usual url-shortener websites are only provide the auto-generated path 
which mean if you shorten some url you'll get something(path) like "www.example.com/ArUfD5" where "ArUfD5" is an auto-generated path.
So I'm come up with the idea that "How about we can custom our own path?" That's why in our website have a custom box for customize
the path name.

so the concept is the same but the UI might be a little be messy
